	<h2>Exercise 7</h2>
</head>
<body>
	<p>The function of this website is to let students know when assignments are due, dates of exams, timetables, subjects, syllabuses, and teachers teaching what classes.</p>
	<p>Since each teacher will be in charge of his/her own page, which includes inserting grades, syllabus, assignment due date, and exam dates, teachers will be responible for updating the information on the website. However, it is important that the school design the style of the website, so that there is consistency bewteen all of the classes and subjects. If each teacher wrote his/her own style, there would be so much inconsistency, and it would be difficult for students to follow. </p>
	<p>Some of the HTML tags that need to be considered are
		<ul>
			<li>headers</li>
			<li>subheaders</li>
			<li>background color</li>
			<li>font</li>
			<li>font size</li>
			<li>font color</li>
			<li>tables</li>
			<li>class/subject tabs</li>
			<li>assignment/grades tabs</li>
			<li>links</li>
		</ul></p>
	<p>These are important tags to consider because they will help with the design and structure of the website. An external CSS sheet can be used to keep the consistency of the different HTML tags. Then, this external CSS sheet can be linked to each teachers own web page, where syllabus, grades, assignments, quizzes, etc. can be found for the class.</p>
