	<h4>Here are the mistakes in the code:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Style should not have a space in it</li>
	<li>"Marginleft" should have a space in it. It should be written as "margin-left"</li>
	<li>The code made all of the text in the body red, instead of just the paragraph that should've been red</li>
	<li>"BODY" should be lowercase</li>
</ul>
